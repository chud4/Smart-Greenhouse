# Abstract
Smart Greenhouses are smart systems that depend on sensors, actuators, and control systems to create an automated microclimate suitable for agriculture. They allow farmers to optimize the yield of the crops using the power of the cloud. 

This project will develop a system that will act as a control system for temperature in an agriculture setting. Using an Arduino Uno, LM34 Temperature sensors and Heltec CubeCell boards, a prototype can be created to automatically capture critical information 24/7 on the crops.

# Pre Requisite Program 
You will need to have an updated version of Adruino to run the program. The version used in this program was 1.8.16.

# Term Definition 
LM34 - Temperature sensor device

Humidity - Approximated concentration of water vapour present in the surrounding atmosphere

Moisture - Level of water concentration present on the surfaces/soil/plants in the environment

Serial - Hardline wiring and messaging system between two devices such as Arduino

LoRa/LoRaWAN - Long Range Wide Area Network, which is a method of wireless communication between devices
