# Smart-Industrial-Interior-Farming
Smart Greenhouses are smart systems that depend on sensors, actuators, and control systems to create an automated microclimate suitable for agriculture. They allow farmers to optimize the yield of the crops using the power of the cloud. As the world population continues to grow at a rate of 0.9% per year, it is projected that the population of the world will be 10 billion by 2050. The UN estimates that food production needs to double by 2050 to feed the world. Farmers around the world have a challenge to improve the efficiency of growing food to meet the demand needed.
This paper explains the importance of smart systems in agriculture and the potential to solve the food problem. Using an Arduino Uno, LM34 Temperature sensors and Heltec CubeCell boards, a prototype can be created to automatically capture critical information 24/7 on the crops.
